       <h2>The memory</h2>
       <p> I was about 11 or 12 when I stumbled onto a strange green-colored fafiction site. It was full of NSFW content. I had no idea waht 18+ meant. There were weird ads blinking on the sides, with women in low quality jpgs saying things like "you won't last 10 seconds." It was chaotic. But unforgettable. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> pop-up windows everywhere</li>
        <li>GIF ads with blinking lights</li>
        <li> Bad fonts, worse formatting</li>
    </ul>

       <p>Looking back, it was Internet 1.0 in its purest form: static, messy, and full of mystery.</p>
